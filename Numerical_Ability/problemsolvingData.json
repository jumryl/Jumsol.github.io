    "question": "You have a bag containing 10 red marbles and 5 blue marbles. If you randomly select two marbles from the bag without replacement, what is the probability that both marbles are blue?",
    "choices": {
      "1": "1/3",
      "2": "1/7",
      "3": "5/15",
      "4": "1/15"
    },
    "answer": "4",
    "explanation": "To find the probability of selecting two blue marbles, first calculate the probability of selecting the first blue marble (5 blue marbles out of 15 total marbles). Then, since one blue marble has been removed, there are 14 marbles left, including 4 blue marbles. Therefore, the probability of selecting the second blue marble is 4 blue marbles out of 14 total marbles. Multiply the probabilities together to find the combined probability: (5/15) * (4/14) = 1/15."
