                    Hi👋 there! I'm Jumryl Solivio, a Software Engineer who created this website to help the
                    candidates in preparing for the Civil Service Exam.

                    As someone who has gone through the process of taking the Civil Service Exam myself, I understand
                    the challenges💪 and difficulties that come with it. Therefore, I decided to create this platform to
                    provide valuable resources and study materials to assist you in your exam preparation journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone 💕, and by sharing these resources, I hope
                    to
                    contribute to your success in the exam and ultimately your career advancement. Remember, preparation
                    is key, and with dedication and hard work, you can achieve your goals.

                    patience during
                    this time.
